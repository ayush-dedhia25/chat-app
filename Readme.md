# Textify! Chat Application

**Textify** is a real-time chat application that provides seamless, instant messaging capabilities, allowing users to communicate effortlessly. Built with **Flask** on the backend and **React** on the frontend, Textify offers features like user authentication, group chat, file sharing, and more, ensuring a robust, user-friendly experience.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **[Backend (Flask + Socket.IO)](./backend/README.md)**  
  The backend handles real-time messaging using Flask and Socket.IO. It manages user authentication, message broadcasting, chat rooms, and message history.

- **[Frontend (React)](./web/README.md)**  
  The frontend provides an intuitive, responsive user interface built with React. It integrates with the backend via Socket.IO for real-time chat, and JWT is used for secure user authentication.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Instant messaging between users and groups.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system using JWT.
- **Message History**: Store and retrieve message history for future reference.
- **File Sharing**: Users can share files, including images and documents.
- **Responsive UI**: The frontend is designed to be mobile-friendly and intuitive.
